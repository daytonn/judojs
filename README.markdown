## About
Judo is a command line application written in ruby that leverages the [Sprockets](http://getsprockets.org/) JavaScript compiler to create modular javascript applications without having to compile your scripts manually. Judo also contains a very barebones JavaScript framework to enforce best practices like namespacing and modular separation.

## Installation

You can install Judo using RubyGems. This is the easiest way of installing and recommended for most users.

	$ gem install judojs

If you want to use the development code you should clone the Git repository and add the binary to your path:

    $ git clone git://github.com/textnotspeech/Judo.git
    $ exprot PATH=/path/to/judo/bin/judo:$PATH
