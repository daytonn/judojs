## About
Judojs is a command line application written in ruby that leverages the [Sprockets](http://getsprockets.org/) JavaScript compiler to create modular javascript applications without having to compile your scripts manually. Judojs also contains a very barebones JavaScript framework to enforce best practices like namespacing and modular separation.

## Installation

You can install Judojs using RubyGems. This is the easiest way of installing and recommended for most users.

  $ gem install judojs


If you want to use the development code you should clone the Git repository and add the binary to your path:

  $ git clone git://github.com/textnotspeech/judojs.git
  $ export PATH=/path/to/judojs/bin:$PATH
